Winnipeg Matters brings actionable, demonstrable solutions to Wininpeg and Manitoba's problems. Expert driven opinions is the goal of most [projects](/projects) that Winnipeg Matters works on.

# What we do

We explore:

* Small quality-of-life improvements such as pedestrian pathways during road construction
* How the hell does public education spending work in Manitoba!?
* And more!

We tell you about them and how to solve them on a local scale in Winnipeg and Manitoba.

# Why it's important

Keeping the context and amount of information available to Winnipeggers and Manitobans is one of the goals of Winnipeg Matters.

Educating the general public about good policies is a lot of work and often the experts who have the ideas are disincentivized to talk about it due to the nature of their employment or the sheer amount of time and energy necessary to get the word out (i.e., climate change).

Complex policies that affect you and your family in a positive fashion is vital for the success of democracy and our families in Manitoba. We're here to guide you to those experts and experiments that objectively improve lives in Manitoba. Not enough people and organizations take the time to do that &mdash; we're here to fix that!

If something doesn't make sense, [let us know]({{ site.email }})! We love talking to other Winnipeggers and we love being proven wrong.

# Our First Project

Our first project that we want to explore is a laundry list of projects from a very high level.

We call it [*The List*](/the_list).
