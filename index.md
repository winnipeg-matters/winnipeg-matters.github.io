Winnipeg Matters brings actionable, demonstratable solutions to Wininpeg and Manitoba's problems. Expert driven opinions is the goal of most projects that Winnipeg Matters works on.

# What we do

We explore:

* Small quality-of-life improvements such as pedestrian pathways during road construction
* How the hell does public education spending work in Manitoba!?
* And more!

We tell you about them and how to solve them on a local scale in Winnipeg and Manitoba.

# Why it's important

Providing context and enough information to Winnipeggers and Manitobans is one of the goals of Winnipeg Matters.

Educating the general public about good policies is a lot of work and often the experts who have the ideas are disincentivized to talk about it. They face the loss of their careers if they were to fervently advocate for ideas presented by us.

Complex policies that affect you and your family in a positive fashion is vital for the success of democracy and our families in Manitoba.

Nuance in our society is important and you deserve to understand fully that nuance when it comes to community-wide decisions and planning.

We're here to guide you to those experts and experiments that objectively improve lives in Manitoba. Not enough people and organizations take the time to do that &mdash; we're here to fix that!

If something doesn't make sense, [let us know]({{ site.email }})! We love talking to other Winnipeggers and we love being proven wrong.

# Our First Project

Our first project that we want to explore is a laundry list of projects from a very high level.

We call it [*The List*](/the_list).

We'll be updating it with new information soon. Follow us to keep up with the developments.
