Councillor expenses! Your City of Winnipeg (CoW) councillor gets $1,XXX per year to spend on their community as they see fit.

We are releasing an email subscription service to be told about what your councillors expense. [Subscribe here]() to be told when we release this service this summer (2019).

## Details
