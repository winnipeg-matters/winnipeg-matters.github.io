What is the Land Value Tax? The LVT (Land Value Tax) replaces property taxes. It sets the property taxes for the land based solely on the land value and it chooses to ignore the buildings on it - for one very good reason: so we can tax unimproved land like vacant lots and parking lots at the same rate as neighbouring land that has buildings.

A house and an adjacent parking lot would then be taxed the same, all things being equal. Raising taxes on underperforming land creates an incentive for the owners to improve the productivity of the land by constructing something there which has a higher rate of return for the owner than the parking lot.

This Strong Towns [YouTube video explaining LVT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok2uR3btMrE) is great. See the aside for the embeded YouTube video of it.

Private surface parking lots are like the ones run by Impark in and around downtown Winnipeg. Improving an area with buildings and amenities that aren't focused on parking allows for a nicer downtown Winnipeg to come into existence. 

South of Portage avenue downtown is a walking desert. Parking lots are interspersed with businesses clinging for survival in the streets between Broadway and Graham avenue. Incentivizing those massive parking lots to be improved to a minimum level of productivity in the form of a building that allows people to use it is a really good idea to create a vibrant, attractive, and wealth generating downtown Winnipeg. 

A parking lot does not go far enough in creating a space that people will enjoy and use. Buildings generally do.

Imagine creating a new restaurant, bar, or coffee shop out of what was once 10 parking spots. We can do that. Now. In Winnipeg. It's real, all it takes is tweaking our proprerty taxes and allowing our experts to guide the design of our city.

This LVT directly incentivizes people to develop underused properties. In fact, in the current system the owners of surface parking lots are incentivized to sit on their land until it becomes incredibly high in demand before selling (speculation). Meanwhile, people who live *right next door* in houses or apartment buildings are paying through the nose. A LVT allows for the city to charge land owners with nothing on it the real costs to the city for services and to encourage those land owners to make the land productive or sell it off to someone who will make it productive.

The actual implementation for Winnipeg is complex and we need experts to plan and advise this. One avenue to explore would be allowing for a period of 5-10 years to switch the taxation system over where each year a percentage of the property taxes is split between traditional property tax assessment and land value tax assessment.

About 50% of downtown Winnipeg's downtown is surface parking lots. The LVT would transform downtown over time. In terms of public policy for downtown development, this is a big one that can be very effective.

Good land use should be incentivized with the right tax. This is a tax known as the 'perfect' tax &mdash; let's bring it to Winnipeg.
