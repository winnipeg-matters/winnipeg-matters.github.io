Winnipeg Matters is a evidence based group. We love to hear dissenting opinions backed up by evidence and we love to provide opinions backed up by evidence.

Two **core tenets** we're starting with:

1. We create easy and hard wins for Manitoba, Winnipeg and Canada from experts' advice
2. Fixing unavoidable problems permanently benefits everyone in the long run. Winnipeg Matters keeps harping on those issues and maintains a record.

[Follow us](/subscribe) to stay up-to-date on matters that affect you as a Winnipegger or a Manitoban.

Feedback? Want to talk to a real human being about issues in Winnipeg?  [Email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

# "How can I help?"

We are looking for:

* Stories to cover
* Ideas to apply to Manitoba and/or Winnipeg
* Experts to weigh in on issue
* Writers to write about issues
* People to write FIPPA requests and to come up with ideas for FIPPA requests

[Reach out and talk to us](mailto:{{ site.email }}), we'd love to talk to you.

We have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=31449205&fan_landing=true) if you wish to show financial support.

# What we do

We explore:

* Small quality-of-life improvements such as pedestrian pathways during road construction
* How the hell does public education spending work in Manitoba!?
* And more!

We tell you about them and how to solve them on a local scale in Winnipeg and Manitoba.

# Why it's important

Providing context and enough information to Winnipeggers and Manitobans is one of the goals of Winnipeg Matters.

Educating the general public about good policies is a lot of work and often the experts who have the ideas are disincentivized to talk about it. They face the loss of their careers if they were to fervently advocate for ideas presented by us.

Complex policies that affect you and your family in a positive fashion is vital for the success of democracy and our families in Manitoba.

Nuance in our society is important and you deserve to understand fully that nuance when it comes to community-wide decisions and planning.

We're here to guide you to those experts and experiments that objectively improve lives in Manitoba. Not enough people and organizations take the time to do that &mdash; we're here to fix that!

If something doesn't make sense, [let us know]({{ site.email }})! We love talking to other Winnipeggers and we love being proven wrong.
