Winnipeg Matters is a evidence based group. We love to hear dissenting opinions backed up by evidence and we love to provide opinions backed up by evidence.

Two **core tenets** we're starting with:

1. We create easy and hard wins for Manitoba, Winnipeg and Canada from experts' advice
2. Fixing unavoidable problems permanently benefits everyone in the long run. Winnipeg Matters keeps harping on those issues and maintains a record.

[Follow us](/subscribe) to stay up-to-date on matters that affect you as a Winnipegger or a Manitoban.
