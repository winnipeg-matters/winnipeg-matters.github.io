*The List*. Solutions to Winnipeg's permanent problems.

With just enough information to fully explain each issue, *The List* exists as a centralized page of government and community design ideas.

Each idea we explore is vetted by experts. We do this because that is a [core tenet of Winnipeg Matters](/about), where:

> We create easy and hard wins for Manitoba, Winnipeg and Canada from experts' advice

Let's explore some of these subjects.

* [Land Value Tax](#land-value-tax-property-taxes)

# Land Value Tax (property taxes)

The LVT (Land Value Tax) changes the amount of money a property is valued at which is the amount of money property owners pay to the City of Winnipeg in [property taxes](http://www.winnipegassessment.com/AsmtTax/English/pdf_forms/property_tax_res_en.html).

In short, Winnipeg (and the rest of Canada) have a property tax system where the land itself is taxed **and the buildings** (improvements) on the land are also taxed. LVT instead taxes land based on only the land value aspect, which equalizes the taxes paid between a surface parking lot and a neighbouring apartment block.  The Strong Towns [video explaining LVT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok2uR3btMrE) is great.

Private surface parking lots like the ones run by Impark are the primary example of this. Land like that would be taxed significantly higher which incentivizes those properties to be further developed because the profits of surface parking lots are less.

The actual implementation for Winnipeg is complex and we need experts to plan and advise this.

About 50% of downtown Winnipeg's downtown is surface parking lots. The LVT would transform downtown with a somewhat simple administrative tax change.

This directly incentivizes people to develop existing underused properties further. In fact, in the current system the owners of surface parking lots are incentivized to sit on their land until it becomes incredibly high in demand. Meanwhile, people who live there in houses or apartment buildings or work in buildings are paying through the nose. LVT fixes that by correctly assessing the value of the property to the city. 

Non-downtown properties and residents massively benefit from this due to less taxes needing to be collected from people whose land is not inherently worth more than land that's centrally located next to more amenities.

Good land use should be incentivized with the right tax. This is a tax known as the 'perfect' tax &mdash; let's bring it to Winnipeg.
