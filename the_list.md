*The List*. Solutions to Winnipeg's permanent problems.

With just enough information to fully explain each issue, *The List* exists as a centralized page of government and community design ideas.

Each idea we explore is vetted by experts. We do this because that is a [core tenet of Winnipeg Matters](/about), where:

> We create easy and hard wins for Manitoba, Winnipeg and Canada from experts' advice

Let's explore some of these subjects.

* [Land Value Tax](#land-value-tax-property-taxes)

# Land Value Tax (property taxes)

The LVT (Land Value Tax) replaces property taxes. Taxing the land based solely on the land value and ignoring the buildings on it is the land value tax. 

A house and an adjacent parking lot would then be taxed the same, all things being equal. Raising taxes on underperforming land creates an incentive for the owners to improve the productivity of the land by constructing something there which has a higher rate of return for the owner than the parking lot.

This Strong Towns [YouTube video explaining LVT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok2uR3btMrE) is great. See the aside for the embeded YouTube video of it.

Private surface parking lots are like the ones run by Impark in and around downtown Winnipeg. Improving an area with buildings and amenities that aren't focused on parking allows for a nicer downtown Winnipeg, among a littany of other reasons. South of Portage avenue downtown is a desert for cars interspersed with businesses surviving despite 0 foot traffic and so incentivizing those massive parking lots to be improved is a really good idea if we want to create a vibrant, attractive, and wealth generating downtown Winnipeg.

We certainly believe that people want to come downtown if there's a good reason - they certainly don't come down for the massive parking deserts! LVT encourages land owners to improve the property or sell it off to someone else for them to improve.

Imagine creating a new restaurant, bar, or coffee shop out of what was once 10 parking spots. We can do that. Now. In Winnipeg. It's real, all it takes is spreading the idea and allowing our experts to guide the design of our city.

This LVT directly incentivizes people to develop underused properties. In fact, in the current system the owners of surface parking lots are incentivized to sit on their land until it becomes incredibly high in demand before selling (speculation). Meanwhile, people who live *right next door* in houses or apartment buildings are paying through the nose. A LVT allows for the city to charge land owners with nothing on it the real costs to the city for services. 

The actual implementation for Winnipeg is complex and we need experts to plan and advise this. One avenue to explore would be allowing for a period of 5-10 years to switch the taxation system over where each year a percentage of the property taxes is split between traditional property tax assessment and land value tax assessment.

About 50% of downtown Winnipeg's downtown is surface parking lots. The LVT would transform downtown with a somewhat simple administrative tax change. In terms of public policy for downtown development, this is a big one that can be very effective.

Good land use should be incentivized with the right tax. This is a tax known as the 'perfect' tax &mdash; let's bring it to Winnipeg.
