The goals we want to achieve for the TPP are:

* Informed voting as a requirement
* Non-superficial understanding of issues
* Evidence based decisions
* Expert facilitated
* In person
* Transparency every decision and piece of information available (auditable too!)
* Strong, informed, trusted committees

That's a lot of goals! Investing your time and mental energy into the TPP has to be as easy as possible while maintaining the highest level of information. To make significant changes, we must invest at a minimum our time. Thank you, thank you, _thank you_ for investing that time into your community, your future, and your children's future.

Explaining each of the goals and how they're achieved is a long process for _anyone_ to understand. For example, the initial idea behind the TPP took over 2.5 hours to explain to one person and the TPP is a project on the order of 10-50 years. Don't feel discouraged if the information seems too dense. The in-person, kind, community-based discussions is another tool to help you make an informed vote while the website is the official, auditable, transparent record for the TPP.

This website provides the transparency and depth of information to those who want to delve into the deep details behind each idea. We want the people who are voting to truly understand the ramifications of approving the TPP, not approving the TPP, and the inaction of not voting at all on the TPP.

"Most inner city neighbourhoods surrounding downtown have not experienced any meaningful revitalization due to lacking in-migration and the absence of targeted revitalization incentives. Winnipeg is comparable to a shiny apple that glistens on the outside but is being eaten by a worm on the inside. An emphasis on suburban developments at the expense of neighbourhood revitalization is a direct causal factor for declining inner city neighbourhoods."
